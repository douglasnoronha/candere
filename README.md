Simple server to view ONVIF cameras as an Android app

# Known Issues

1) It looks like you can only add one camera per app launch, (I'm sorry) but you'll have to restart the app to add another camera.
2) RTSP is finicky
3) If you try the URL from another browser, the HTTP server *might* just reject your request. I couldn't figure this out.
